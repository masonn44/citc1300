//i just kinda deleted the old project because every i opened the project in browser it was showing the old project and not the new one i was working on cuz it was like prioritizing the link to the old one i think even tho i changed the destination im not really sure what was going on tbh but i know that deleting the old project fixed it and i thought i didnt need it anymore ? but now in the sixth video youre saying to keep it and just add a new link which at the start when it wasnt working i didnt realize was an option so like its gone now and thats why just letting you know
