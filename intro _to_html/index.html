        <h1>The Plot</h1>
        <p>Out of the several dozen anime i have watched, "Frieren" is by far my favorite. It is about an elf girl who is thousands of years old learning to value her
            connections with others. It is a masterfully written story that tackles the human condition and shows why we ought to spend as much time as possible with those we love.
            I seriously cannot recommend it enough. I have shown it to my mother, and couple cousins, and some friends and everyone I have blessed with this show has loved it endlessly.

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>This show has some of the most well written characters from any piece of media I have ever cosumed. All of them show icredible development as the story progresses.
            Watching these characters grow and learn from each other is easily one of the most satisfying experiences a show movie or book has ever given me. They all have their own
            personal stories to follow with a wonderful level of detail and nuance that really makes each and every one of them feel real in a way few other stories have pulled off.
            Several of my all time favorite characters, including my number one favorite character of all time, come from this story.

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>Along with this animes incredible story and character writing comes some of the best animation I have ever seen from an anime. For starters all of the backgrounds and
            settings are incredibly detailed with immaculate color choices. The animation is extremely smooth and flows very well. Characters clothes and hair flow in the wind
            in places where other shows would just use a still image. Also while the fights in the story are few and far between they are still insanely well animated.
            For a story where the fights are not usually a part of the main plot they really put a ton of effort into making them epic as all hell.
